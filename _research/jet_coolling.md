# Objective
Developing numerical model for predicting the heat transfer performance of the the jet impingement cooling system.

# Abstract
The circular, liquid jet impingement provides a convenient way of cooling surfaces. To effectively cool the devices inside the electric vehicle, a rotating jet impingement cooling system is designed to evaluate the potential of the jet impingement for high heat flux removal. The liquid used for jet impingement is automatic transmission fluid. The jet impingement system consists of a rotating pipe with two nozzles and a cylindrical ring which is attached to the heat source. The numerical simulation using the commercial code is performed to determine the heat flux removal performance over the cylindrical surface. The numerical results are compared with the empirical formula and experimental measurements from the literature. Furthermore, the effects of the Reynolds number and pipe rotation on the jet impingement cooling performance are also investigated.
