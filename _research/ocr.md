# Objective
 Development of real-time hand-written digits recognition system.

# Abstract
In this project, the hand-written digits recognition system is developed. The camera is utilized to capture the hand-written digits image in a real-time manner. The captured image is processed to provide suitable features to a trained artificial neural network to provide the recognition results. The proposed system is implemented with Matlab with graphic user interface developed.
