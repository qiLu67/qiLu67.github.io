# Objective
Designing and building a mini-GVT system using 3D printing for concept validation.

<!--# Abstract
Weeble is a small self-balancing robot like Segway. It has two wheels driven by two DC motors. It can stand and balance by itself. And it can move forward and back and make turns without falling down on the ground. The design of the robot is based on the model of inverted pendulum and moving cart. It has gyro sensors and accelerometers as inertia measure unit (IMU) and the sonar to avoid obstacles. The control loop features a PID controller loop. It also has the radio communication module for wireless connection to the computer.
